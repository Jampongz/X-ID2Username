## Overview

Welcome to the **X-ID2Username** repository! This project aims to simplify the process of converting user IDs from follower.js, a component of the X (formerly Twitter) data archive, into a list of usernames. With this tool, you can easily retrieve usernames for any user ID you have collected from your follower data.

### Why X-ID2Username?

When working with social media data, especially from X, you often end up with user IDs instead of usernames. This can make it challenging to analyze your follower base or understand your audience. X-ID2Username bridges that gap, allowing you to convert those IDs into meaningful usernames.

### Key Features

- **User-Friendly**: Designed for simplicity and ease of use.
- **Efficient**: Quickly converts a large number of IDs.
- **Headless Operation**: Uses Selenium for seamless operation without a visible browser.
- **Cross-Platform**: Works on any system that supports Python.
